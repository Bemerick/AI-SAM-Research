2. **Click a card** - Go to detail page
3. **Update workflow** - Change Review For Bid to "Yes"
4. **Save changes** - Should see "Saved successfully!"
5. **Navigate** - Try High Scoring and Match Review pages

## Current Data

With the test opportunity we added (TEST001):
- **Fit Score:** 8.5 (High)
- **Should appear in:** All Opportunities AND High Scoring
- **Department:** Department of Agriculture
- **Practice Area:** Business & Technology Services

## Next Steps

The frontend is complete and functional! Here's what works:

✅ **All Pages**: Dashboard, Detail, High Scoring, Match Review
✅ **All Components**: Grid cards, filters, workflow controls, match cards

## Overall Progress

- ✅ Phase 1: Database (100%)
- ✅ Phase 2: Backend API (100%)
- ✅ Phase 3: Frontend (100%)
- ⏳ Phase 4: GovWin Integration (0%)
- ⏳ Phase 5: AI Match Evaluation (0%)

**Current Completion: ~70%**

## What's Left
