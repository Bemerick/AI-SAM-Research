      "descriptionText": "<p><strong>1. &nbsp;CONTRACT INFORMATION:</strong> &nbsp;Architect-Engineer (A-E) services procured in accordance with PL 92-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and FAR Part 36, are required for construction management and other various services within the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Honolulu District (POH) Area of Responsibility (AOR). &nbsp;The POH AOR includes State of Hawaii, territories of Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), Federal States of Micronesia (FSM), American Samoa, and Kwajalein Atoll, and Republic of the Marshall Islands.</p>\n\n<p>Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDCs) will be negotiated and awarded with a base period of five (5) years with an option to extend services for six (6) months. It is the Government&rsquo;s intent to award at least three small business (SB) A_E IDCs with a not-to-exceed shared capacity of $9,900,000. The Government obligates itself to obtain no less than $1,000.00 in services.&nbsp;The criteria set forth in FAR 36.602-1 will be utilized for the selection of A-E Offerors rather than competitive bidding procedures, with the contracts anticipated to be awarded in November 2025. Labor and Overhead rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract.</p>\n\n<p>After contracts are awarded, work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders. Task order selection procedures will be in accordance with applicable regulations.&nbsp; When the Government awards a task order under this MATOC, the Contracting Officer will notify all A-E Offerors within the MATOC pool of the task order requirement. The Task Order Requirement Notice (TORN) will include a short summary of the scope of work, selection criteria, and may include a request for supplemental information tailored to the specific task order requirement. Alternatively, the Government may feel that they have enough information to make the selection, in which case, no request for supplemental information will be made. Using the selection criteria specified in the TORN, the selection board will evaluate the SF-330s on file and responses to the Task Order Questionnaire to determine the most highly qualified Offeror for the specific task order requirement. The board will submit a report to the Selection Board Authority who will then make the selection in accordance with AFARS 5136.602-4 and 5136.602-5 and USACE implementation guidance.</p>\n\n<p>Each A-E Offeror selected under this announcement will be asked if they would like to update their SF330s on an annual basis in accordance with FAR 36.603(d).</p>\n\n<p>To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM) database. For instruction on registering with SAM see the SAM website at https://www.sam.gov/.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>2. </strong>&nbsp;<strong>PROJECT INFORMATION:</strong> &nbsp;Work primarily includes, but is not limited to, construction management services for pre-construction award, construction administration, and quality assurance functions and provide Construction Managers, Project Engineers, Project Schedulers, and Quality Assurance Representatives/ Inspectors.

Criteria &ldquo;a.&rdquo; through &ldquo;e.&rdquo; are considered primary. Criteria &ldquo;f.&rdquo; through &ldquo;g.&rdquo; are considered secondary and will only be used as tiebreakers among highly qualified Offerors that are ranked technically equal using the primary criteria. Content provided by the Offeror beyond the stated maximums will not be evaluated.</p>\n\n<p><u>a. Specialized Experience and Technical Qualifications:</u></p>\n\n<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The evaluation will consider the extent of the Offeror&rsquo;s experience of the prime firm and sub-consultants for the services described in paragraph 2 &quot;Project Information.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>SF330 requirement(s): &nbsp;A maximum of five (5) example projects may be submitted for consideration under SF330, Part I, Section F. &nbsp;Example projects shall be within seven (7) years of the pre-solicitation closing date specified in Paragraph 5. &nbsp;All projects shall clearly state the start and completion dates as well a clear project scope.&nbsp; Additional information demonstrating an Offeror&#39;s qualifications may be presented under SF330, Part I, Section H (Additional Information).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Experience. Demonstrate experience in accomplishing relevant projects as described in section 2 (Project Information) of this solicitation. Projects of greater relevance/scope/complexity, will be evaluated more favorably.

The government will evaluate, as appropriate, the registration, education, certifications, overall and relevant project experience, and longevity with the firm. Provide Section G Key Personnel Participation In Example Projects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This criterion focuses on the qualifications of the key personnel for the contract and not the quantity of personnel, which is addressed under the &quot;capacity to accomplish the work&quot; criterion.</p>\n\n<p>Provide key personnel resumes for the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>CONSTRUCTION MANAGERS</li>\n\t<li>PROJECT ENGINEERS</li>\n\t<li>PROJECT SCHEDULERS</li>\n\t<li>QUALITY ASSURANCE REPRESENTATIVES/INSPECTORS</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><u>c. Knowledge of Locality:</u></p>\n\n<p>Offerors key personnel will be evaluated on specific familiarity with the site conditions in Hawaii and other areas of the USACE Pacific Ocean Honolulu (POH) Area of Responsibility (AOR). &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;Knowledge of the local conditions, including physical environment, local and applicable engineering criteria/codes/processes of local city/county/state/federal jurisdictions/authorities, and construction market conditions and methods will be evaluated. &nbsp;Example projects performed within the USACE POH AOR will have greater weight than those performed outside the USACE POH AOR.&nbsp; The basis of evaluation for this criterion will focus on the information provided in SF330, Part I, Section E (Resume of Key Personnel), Section F (Example Projects), and H (Additional Information).</p>\n\n<p><u>d. Past Performance:</u></p>\n\n<p>The evaluation will consider all past performance of the prime A-E contractor as documented in the Government&#39;s Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) managed through the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS). Offerors will be evaluated on past performance on schedule, cost, and management. Performance evaluations for the prime firm is considered the most relevant criteria; however, past performance for any significant subconsultants may also be considered. Performance evaluations on completed projects within seven (7) years of solicitation closing date and/or SF 330 Section F example projects is also considered more relevant.&nbsp; Final evaluations have higher value than interim evaluations.</p>\n\n<p>Any credible, documented information on past performance may be submitted, but the government is not required to seek other information on past performance if none is available through PPIRS. An offeror may use Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQ) to provide or supplement a firm&#39;s past performance. Firms choosing to use the PPQ may obtain a PPQ standard form by submitting a request to POCs indicated in this solicitation.</p>\n\n<p><u>e.

Volume of recent DoD contract awards:</u></p>\n\n<p>Provide a complete listing of all work awarded to the Offeror within the previous twelve (12) months of this solicitation&rsquo;s closing date. &nbsp;When identifying the total volume of work, include all stand-alone or indefinite delivery contract (IDC) task orders, including modifications, issued by DoD agencies. &nbsp;For IDCs, include total value of task orders actually issued by agencies in the last 12 months.&nbsp; DO NOT include the potential value of an IDC, nor options which have not been exercised. &nbsp;For all types of contracts, do not include for consideration options that have not been exercised. Present information for this criterion in SF330, Part I, Section H (Additional Information).</p>\n\n<p><u>g. Small Business Participation:</u></p>\n\n<p>Extent of participation of small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small businesses (WOSB), HUBZone small businesses, Veteran Owned small businesses, and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses will be measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort. The greater the participation, the greater the consideration. Present information for this criterion in SF330, Part I, Section H (Additional Information).</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>4. BASIS FOR ADJECTIVAL EVALUATION:&nbsp; </strong>An adjectival rating scale will be applied to each selection criteria with the highest possible rating first and in descending order: Excellent, Highly Acceptable, Acceptable, Marginal, Unacceptable.</p>\n\n<p><u>Excellent (E):</u> The proposal is outstanding in that it clearly demonstrates a thorough understanding of the requirements and greatly exceeds the minimum level for the criterion. The Offeror&rsquo;s capabilities are of the highest proficiency and are thoroughly illustrated or substantiated. The proposal is internally consistent throughout when addressing the criterion. The proposal has significant strengths in exceeding the minimum level of the criterion and contains no weaknesses or deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p><u>Highly Acceptable (HA):</u> The proposal is very good, demonstrates good understanding of requirements, and exceeds the minimum level for the criterion. The Offeror&rsquo;s capabilities are of high proficiency and are well justified or substantiated. The proposal contains very minor or no inconsistencies with other portions of the proposal when addressing the criterion. The proposal has strengths in exceeding the minimum level for the criterion and is not significantly offset by weaknesses and contains no deficiencies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><u>Acceptable (A):</u> The proposal is acceptable in that it meets the minimum level for the criterion. The proposal demonstrates an acceptable level of understanding of requirements. The Offeror&rsquo;s capabilities are of an acceptable level of competency and are sufficiently illustrated or substantiated. The proposal contains minor or no inconsistencies or incompatibilities with other portions of the proposal when addressing the criterion. The proposal has strengths in meeting the minimum level for the criterion and is not significantly offset by weaknesses and/or deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p><u>Marginal (M):</u> The proposal does not meet the minimum level for the criterion and does not demonstrate an acceptable level of understanding the requirements. The proposal is weak in providing sufficient evidence to demonstrate or illustrate its qualifications or capabilities to perform the anticipated work at an acceptable level of quality. The proposal contains inconsistencies in addressing the criterion. The proposal may have strengths in meeting a portion of the criterion; however, it is offset by weaknesses and/or deficiencies.<br />\n<u>Unacceptable (U):</u> The proposal is incomplete in that it does not satisfactorily meet the minimum level for this criterion. There is little to no evidence to illustrate that the Offeror understands the government&rsquo;s minimum requirements. The proposal lacks evidence to demonstrate or illustrate its capabilities to perform the anticipated work. The proposal may have strengths in meeting a portion of the criterion; however, it is completely offset by various inconsistencies, weaknesses, and deficiencies. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><u>Only applies to Past Performance Acceptable (A)</u>:&nbsp; The Offeror lacks past performance information in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). The intent of this rating is not to penalize the Offeror for no past performance as a Prime A-E firm. Therefore, the Government will deem the Offeror to have an &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo; past performance. In the context of acceptability / unacceptability for past performance, &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo; shall be considered &ldquo;Acceptable.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>5. &nbsp;SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: &nbsp;</strong>Interested Offerors having the capabilities to perform this work must submit the following no later than May 28, 2025, 2:00 PM Hawaii Standard Time.</p>\n\n<p>a.
