Eastern Time (ET) on 21 October 2025<br />\n<br />\n1. INTRODUCTION<br />\nThe General Services Administration (GSA), Assisted Acquisition Services (AAS) is releasing this Market Assessment Discussion (MAD) notice on behalf of The United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The purpose of this notice is to assist the Government in conducting market research regarding the subject requirements, promote competition, and garner high-quality proposals.<br />\nAs provided by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 10.002 and 15.201, the Government anticipates conducting one-on-one virtual meetings with respondents to this notice to promote competition in a potential future acquisition. The Government is particularly interested in gathering information on industry best practices for<br />\n&bull; hosting and managing assessment content (e.g., items, item banks) in a secure environment,<br />\n&bull; delivering assessments in a secure unproctored asynchronous environment,<br />\n&bull; delivering online video-based interviews<br />\n&bull; remote proctoring,<br />\n&bull; using Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning in assessment development and scoring,<br />\n&bull; minimizing and/or mitigating applicant use of Artificial Intelligence (e.g, AI chatbots) to improve assessment performance<br />\n&bull; facilitating data sharing, including PII, between integrated platforms,<br />\n&bull; integrating and delivering assessments across multiple assessment platforms,<br />\n&bull; and ensuring scalable governmentwide assessment delivery.<br />\nThis information will be used for market research only and any information provided by an Industry Partner because of these conversations will not be shared with any other Industry Partner. The Government is not obligated to release a future solicitation.<br />\nThe MAD is a market research method utilized by AAS Army to determine the extent of interest in a specific acquisition and industry practices related to the acquisition.

Any information submitted by respondents as a result of this notice is strictly voluntary.</p>\n\n<p>2. BACKGROUND<br />\nThe landscape for Federal hiring has changed dramatically in the past 12 months. The Chance to Compete Act of 2024 (CCA), Executive Order 14170 (Reforming the Federal Hiring Process and Restoring Merit to Government Service, January 20, 2025) and the Merit Hiring Plan (MHP, issued May 29, 2025) require Federal agencies to: a) incorporate skills-based assessments into their hiring processes; and b) eliminate the use of self-rating assessment questionnaires that have been used pervasively across government for many years. The United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is the central agency for providing human resources solutions to Federal agencies. Through its Human Resources Solutions (HRS) Federal Staffing Center (FSC) USA<br />\nHire \u2120 Program Office, OPM provides Federal agencies with high-quality assessment tools through a centralized assessment platform that meets the goal of more efficient evaluation of applicants and better-quality hires across government. USA Hire \u2120 includes a range of assessment solutions that can help agencies meet skills-based assessment requirements. In Fiscal Year 2024, USA Hire \u2120 customer agencies used the program to assess approximately 1 million applicants for over 20,000 job opportunity announcements; OPM expects continued exponential growth in the use of its assessments in future fiscal years. USA Hire \u2120 provides an online assessment program designed specifically to meet the hiring needs of government agencies. Federal agencies need professionally developed and validated assessment tools to identify highly qualified and proficient applicants and ultimately make the best hires. Better assessments can lead to better hires and a stronger workforce that builds a high performing organization set up to achieve mission success. USA Hire \u2120 currently offers off-the-shelf assessment batteries covering over 800 individual job series/grade combinations, off-the-shelf assessment batteries covering skills and competencies shared across jobs (e.g., project management, writing, data skills, supervisory skills), and custom assessment batteries targeting the needs of individual agencies, access to test center locations worldwide, and a broad array of assessment and IT expertise. HRS can develop, customize, and deliver assessment solutions that effectively and efficiently meet the needs of Federal agencies. USA Hire \u2120 was built specifically for use in the Federal Government; USA Hire \u2120 fully integrates with USA Staffing&reg;; USA Hire \u2120 meets all Federal IT standards; and USA Hire \u2120 maintains high levels of security, accessibility, and usability. Agencies use the USA Hire \u2120 platform to administer a wide variety of online assessments such as traditional multiple-choice assessments, sophisticated work simulations, video-based assessments, computer adaptive tests (CAT), computer-scored writing assessments, video-based interviews, and more.<br />\nUSA Hire \u2120 currently blends state-of-the-art assessments and technology enabled assessment delivery solutions to modernize and transform the Federal hiring process. Through USA Hire \u2120 , Federal agencies have access to online assessment (proctored and un-proctored) products and services with the goals of helping to manage large applicant pools, improving the quality of hires, decreasing the time-to-hire, minimizing applicant burden, and improving the applicant experience. USA Hire \u2120 is part of an integrated solution that currently combines HRS&rsquo; internal expertise (e.g., Industrial/Organizational Psychology, staff acquisition), assessment technology resources (USAJOBS and USA Staffing) with the external capabilities of industry partner(s).<br />\nUSA Hire \u2120 includes computer adaptive testing technology. All assessments are fully compliant with Section 508 of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act, and video-based items are supported by an HTML5-based video player and allow for closed-captioned videos. USA Hire \u2120 also complies with all Federal IT security and privacy mandates.</p>\n\n<p>3. SCOPE<br />\nThe USA Hire \u2120 program seeks an industry partner-provided commercial solution that meets the needs of its federal customer base. OPM requires an online system that can deploy off-the-shelf and custom assessments that measure a variety of competencies for Federal occupations. OPM seeks an assessment delivery system that can automatically score closed-end and open-ended responses, including writing samples. The online assessment platform shall be able to handle any mathematical formula for scoring purposes. Based on the needs of USA Hire \u2120 &rsquo;s customers, OPM requires an assessment platform that supports static, multi-form, computer-adaptive (CAT), and linear-on-the-fly (LOFT) assessments delivered in un-proctored, in-person, and remote proctored settings. The platform shall support applicant self-scheduling for proctored test sessions. The platform shall additionally support the delivery of synchronous (live) and asynchronous (recorded) online interviews, online interview scheduling, and provide an interface for raters to review and rate applicant interviews. Online interviews shall be delivered through the&nbsp;integration with USA Staffing and combinable with other assessments. The platform shall include an interface for OPM and customer Industrial/Organizational Psychologists to author, upload, and configure tests, and to manage assessment processes. The contractor shall be able to support secure, standardized, real-time data interconnections with other assessment delivery platforms and provide the government with access to additional online assessments, including technical skills-based assessment content (e.g., accounting, coding, cybersecurity, engineering). All assessment platforms shall rely on the applicant&rsquo;s USAJOBS Login.gov account or Federal employee&rsquo;s USA Hire \u2120 Login.gov account for authentication.<br />\nOPM requires an industry partner that can provide psychometric expertise to support Federal Industrial/Organizational Psychologist resources in developing and implementing valid, defensible assessment batteries for the USA Hire \u2120 customer base, which may include conducting job analyses, data analyses, integrating multiple content sources, and evaluating and interpreting results. The USA Hire \u2120 contractor will also support OPM program evaluation efforts that assess the current health of USA Hire \u2120 and guide the program&rsquo;s strategic direction. OPM also seeks to leverage vendor partner resources for project management in support of assessment and talent acquisition projects with customer agencies.<br />\nOPM requires an industry partner whose platform and psychometric support can dynamically scale to support both the growth and surge needs of the USA Hire \u2120 program. The CCA and MHP foster the use of skill-based and competency-based technical assessments by requiring at least one technical or alternative assessment in competitive hiring processes. Further, the MHP strongly encourages the use of multiple-hurdle assessment approaches and encourages agencies to use USA Hire \u2120 assessments. OPM intends to position USA Hire \u2120 as the assessment program of choice for agencies to meet their competitive hiring assessment needs. To provide an idea of the potential scale, the approximately 1 million applicants for more than 20,000 job opportunity announcements mentioned earlier represent less than 20% of competitive hiring across the government in FY24. While it is challenging to estimate the exact number of assessments to be delivered in future years given the variation in needs across government and the current gap in use of skills-based assessments, the USA Hire \u2120 program anticipates the need to support the delivery of online assessment batteries for several million applicants per year. OPM is seeking an industry partner who can assist the USA Hire \u2120 program with delivering online assessments at scale across government as efficiently and effectively as possible.<br />\nIn sum, OPM requires a contractor that is able to deliver:<br />\n&bull; Psychometric expertise to manage and support delivery of online assessment solutions<br />\n&bull; A scalable solution that can efficiently address both expected growth and surge demands<br />\n&bull; An online assessment solution/platform for use in proctored and un-proctored environments that also allows for assessment scheduling<br />\n&bull; Assessment delivery in proctored and un-proctored environments using a variety of delivery engines (e.g. static, CAT)<br />\n&bull; Delivery of online video-based interviews in both synchronous and asynchronous modes<br />\n&bull; Reporting to document activities, results, system performance, system maintenance and other relevant information<br />\n&bull; Responses to and support for data calls<br />\n&bull; System management, integration, and testing services<br />\n&bull; Help desk support<br />\n&bull; Ensuring approved reasonable accommodations are applied at proctored test centers<br />\n&bull; Project management and program reviews<br />\n&bull; Program evaluation<br />\n&bull; Data analytics<br />\n&bull; Ease of editing candidate-focused content (notifications, instructions, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>1.

All outstanding responses have now been published.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of this post is to release additional responses associated with the question period that closed 15 September 2025.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of Amendment 0002 is to update the following: (1) the PIEE file size limitation in L-1.3 is updated to 5MB, (2) Small Business Subcontracting Plans in L-2.4 shall use a sample dollar value of $151,000,000,000, and (3) L-3.0 contained a typo. All other terms and conditions remain unchanged. The solicitation and supporting amendments are posted in PIEE. The solicitation generated considerable interest. The purpose of Amendment 0001 is to update the solicitation based on inquiries from industry. The question period is closed, and the MDA does not intend to initiate a subsequent question period. Offerors are encouraged to carefully review Amendment 0001 and the associated documents in their entirety. Please note, in accordance with FAR 19.102, the solicitation is updated to reflect only one NAICS code, 541715. As a result, several updates have been made to the solicitation. The Offeror?s corporate experience will not be rated unacceptable or considered not responsible for award of the SHIELD IDIQ if this specific NAICS code is not listed in the Offeror?s SAM registration. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) announces the release of the Multiple Award Scalable Homeland Innovative Enterprise Layered Defense (SHIELD) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Request for Proposal (RFP) using a full and open competition. This final RFP supersedes any draft RFP information posted to date. As a long-planned strategy, SHIELD will allow MDA and other DoD entities to rapidly issue orders under one enterprise flexible vehicle. The proposed contract vehicle anticipates a period of performance of 10 years, which will consist of a base ordering period and one or more optional ordering periods. The anticipated stated maximum value is $151 Billion. Individual order awards will consist of various contract types across various NAICS codes. MDA has created a helpful information resource document to assist potential offerors in developing a responsive proposal. This document addresses common areas of inquiry and provides guidance designed to clarify instructions and facilitate proposal preparation. Potential offerors are encouraged to thoroughly review the information provided in this helpful information resource document and the solicitation/RFP in its entirety. Any questions shall be submitted via a Microsoft Form located at https://forms.osi.apps.mil/r/e2y0QrsDUW no later than 3:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time (CDT) on 15 September 2025.

The Source Selection procedures are in accordance with FAR Part 15 Contracting by Negotiations. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2025-05 and DFARS Publication 20250117.</p>\n\n<p>This solicitation is issued for 100% total small business set-aside.&nbsp; The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is&nbsp;<u>611430</u>, with a size standard of $<u>12,000.000 million.</u></p>\n\n<p>All applicable Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) provisions and clauses are contained in SF 1449 M00263-25-R-1005 &nbsp;attached to this synopsis. Offerors responding to this announcement shall submit their quotes in accordance with FAR Part 12 and additional instructions, conditions, and notices to offerors provided in Section L of the attached SF1449. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this acquisition and its addendum provision.&nbsp; In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 15, the Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.&nbsp; The Government intends to award a contract to the offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the Government. The Government will execute the evaluation using the Best Value Tradeoff process, as defined in FAR 15.101-1. Proposals will be evaluated using FAR 15- Contracting by Negotiations, including a Tradeoff process between price and non-price factors.&nbsp; The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.</p>\n\n<p>Proposals will be assessed for how well the offeror&rsquo;s proposal meets the solicitation requirements and the risks associated with the offeror&rsquo;s approach.</p>\n\n<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>\n\n<p>Factor 1</p>\n\n<p>Technical Capability</p>\n\n<p>Factor 2</p>\n\n<p>Past Performance</p>\n\n<p>Factor 3</p>\n\n<p>Price</p>\n\n<p>The non-price evaluation factors (Factors 1 and 2) are listed in descending order of importance. Both non-price factors when combined are significantly more important than Factor 3 &ndash; Price. Factor 3- Price becomes increasingly more important when Offerors receive similar ratings for the non-price factors. Prospective Offerors are forewarned that a proposal meeting solicitation requirements with the lowest evaluated price may not be selected for award if a higher rated evaluated price proposal is determined to be most advantageous to the Government.</p>\n\n<p>Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with its offer.&nbsp; Clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.&nbsp; All other additional contract requirement for this acquisition can be found in the attached SF 1449.</p>\n\n<p>The Government will answer questions received up to <strong><u>ten (10) days </u></strong>after release of the solicitation and will provide responses to interested parties via an amendment to the solicitation.&nbsp; Questions received after that time may not be answered.&nbsp; Additional information is provided in the SF1449.</p>\n\n<p>The closing date and time for this solicitation is 31 October 2025 at 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.</p>\n\n<p>Points of contact:</p>\n\n<p>Captain Zach Keener 843-228-2129,&nbsp;&nbsp; zachary.e.keener.mil@usmc.mil</p>\n\n<p>Kacy M.
