      "description": "<p>The Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security Administration has a requirement for&nbsp;Bottle Liquid Scanner (BLS), Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT), and Explosives Trace Detection (ETD)&nbsp;technologies and associated support services.</p>\n\n<h4>BACKGROUND</h4>\n\n<p>The mission of the TSA is to protect the nation&rsquo;s transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce. To achieve its mission, the TSA must ensure that its security screening equipment is both effective and efficient. This includes security equipment used at all domestic transportation facilities, including aviation, rail, other surface transportation, and maritime transportation (including port security). The TSA&rsquo;s AR portfolio is responsible for secondary screening of potential threats, and the OPS portfolio is responsible for screening people for potential threats. TSA is continuously evaluating and modernizing processes and capabilities to strengthen the agency&rsquo;s ability to respond to adversarial actors, detect emerging and evolving threats, and enable efficient and effective targeting of screening resources.</p>\n\n<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>\n\n<p>To establish enhanced operational and detection capabilities, which are outlined below.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Bottled Liquid Scanner\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>The BLS is equipment designed to detect a wide range of hazardous and prohibited substances in liquids, aerosols, and gels contained in bottles or other sealed containers. Any liquid, aerosol, gel, cream, or paste that alarms during the initial screening process requires secondary screening. The BLS can identify hazardous substances, including explosives and toxic chemicals using advanced detection technologies such as Raman spectroscopy and infrared analysis. The BLS can differentiate between safe liquids like water, juice, or shampoo and dangerous substances without opening the container, ensuring minimal disruption at security checkpoints. It can analyze a variety of container materials, including plastic, glass, and metals, and can effectively scan liquids of varying viscosities and compositions. Additionally, the BLS provides rapid and accurate results, making it suitable for high throughput environments such as the security checkpoint.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Advanced Imaging Technology\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>TSA is looking to establish OPS solutions with a focus on enhancing threat detection capabilities with reduced false alarm rates to reduce contact between passengers and TSOs, moving passengers through the checkpoint in a continuous manner, standardizing image display, and enabling operational connectivity through secure data transmission.&nbsp;</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Explosives Trace Detection\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>ETD technology is used to screen travelers and their property. ETD systems identify trace threats by detecting the chemical attributes/signatures of microscopic residue of threat compounds. The technology is highly sensitive, thereby enabling fast and accurate screening for trace explosives on a variety of surfaces and can be used in all public areas and airports to screen people and their accessible property for the presence of trace threats. The operational procedure includes the collection and analysis of a sample. The ETD system then informs the user both visually and audibly if the sample contains a prohibited threat(s). TSA&rsquo;s goal is to enable fast and accurate screening for trace threats on a variety of surfaces.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n",

      "description": "<p>The Department of Health and Human Services, Indian Health Service, Bemidji Area Office may have a&nbsp;continuing requirement for Healthcare Clearinghouse Services.</p>\n\n<h4>BACKGROUND</h4>\n\n<p>Bemidji Area Indian Health Service provides service and support to 34 Federally-recognized Tribes and 4 Urban Indian Health programs located in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Tribal Health services are provided through 11 P.L. 93-638 Title V compacts and 23 Title I contracts. Urban Indian Health programs are located in Chicago, IL; Detroit, MI; Milwaukee, WI; and Minneapolis, MN. Tribes in the Bemidji Area include Ojibwe (Chippewa), Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Mohican, Oneida, Odawa, Potawatomi, and Sioux. The BAO operates three Federal/direct service programs on behalf of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians and the White Earth Band of Chippewa Indians of Minnesota. These Federal/direct service programs include Cass Lake Hospital, Red Lake Hospital, and White Earth Health Center.</p>\n\n<p>All three facilities provide moderately complex health care services surrounding primary care, preventive medicine, pediatrics, emergency care, optometry, dentistry, and behavioral health care. Two of these facilities are designated as Critical Access Hospitals and operate robust Emergency Department services. Bemidji Area Indian healthcare is funded primarily using third party reimbursements, so collections are vital to sustaining operations and expanding quality patient care. The BAO seeks to establish a centralized healthcare revenue cycle management solution that that offers an intuitive and unified user experience using available Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) technology to conduct patient third-party eligibility checks, prior authorizations, claims management (including clearinghouse, scrub claims, transmit claims, denial management, accept remittance advice, produce reports), facilitate payer enrollments, and patient payment processing. Patient and Claim information must be securely exchanged with outside insurance payers; assuming all electronic transactions and Direct Data Entry (DDE)/Florida Information Shared System (FISS), which includes CMS Section 1011 billing, access with confidentiality, authentication, integrity, and nonrepudiation for the Bemidji Area Indian Health Service Office. In order to standardize processes and streamline implementation and daily maintenance, the use of one clearinghouse that uses EDI technology is sought for three federal service units. Revenue Cycle Management Services (here in described as Clearinghouse services) provide enhanced and maximized third party revenue in a streamlined, electronic approach to claim submission. Use of a clearinghouse substantially reduces the adjudication timeframe of claims from 30+ days to 10 business days; real-time batch receipt verification; realtime verification of eligibility for most (if not all) insurance payers; identification of claim formatting errors; ability to correct electronic claims within the claim portal; ability to receive electronic remittance advices; ability to process credit card payments--all of these processes to be processed within one portal.</p>\n\n<p>Clearinghouse Services will provide patient eligibility checking, initial scrubbing of all electronic third-party claims produced by Resource Patient Management System (RPMS) data system, provide efficient denial management work queues to track and process work-loads, EFT and ERA capabilities, and credit card payment processing capacity. RPMS is an integrated solution for the management of clinical, business practice, and administrative information in healthcare facilities of various sizes. Flexible hardware configurations, over 50 software applications, and appropriate network communication components combine to provide a comprehensive clinical, financial, and administrative solution.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>PREVIOUS REQUIREMENTS</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Maintain EDI transaction capability throughout the term of this contract to deliver consistency in process as well as standardized execution at all Federal sites is a goal of instituting this contract; speed in maximizing revenue return is the primary goal. Electronic submission of clean claims means faster payment receipt and lower aged&nbsp;receivables. The overall effectiveness and quality of these activities will be monitored using standard, regular reports. The service must meet established Federal security requirements</li>\n\t<li>Clearinghouse will provide a single, unified user experience which means user log-on to one system</li>\n\t<li>Clearinghouse will provide real-time point-of-service eligibility data from third party insurance databases to include commercial payers, Medicare intermediaries, and state Medicaid plans. Queries will be conducted pre-encounter. This may occur in either batches the day before or in real-time</li>\n\t<li>Clearinghouse will provide secure data transmission of all electronic claims, approximately 45,000 encounters per month for three service units. Payer enrollment and ability to transmit electronic VA claims is required</li>\n\t<li>Clearinghouse will provide initial data checks, initial data scrubbing to ensure clean claim submission to the end-payer, and claim status inquiry and response</li>\n\t<li>Clearinghouse will ensure HIPAA Compliant transactions and password protected access and meet IHS security requirements</li>\n\t<li>Clearinghouse will have capabilities to drop an electronic claim to paper</li>\n\t<li>All claims with errors will be rejected to a site within the portal where rework can occur. Portal should have simple response rejections messages and intuitive interactive decision support through use of &lsquo;help tiles&rsquo; within the portal. Claim attachment functionality is necessary. The denial workflow allows direct resubmission</li>\n\t<li>All inquiries and responses will provide accurate and up-to-date eligibility information available to the end user. All information will be uploaded for electronic claims transmissions in order for clean claim billing and third-party revenue activities. ? Summary integrated dashboard reports with top tile metrics are needed for ongoing performance tracking, tracking aging receivables, and employee assignments</li>\n\t<li>Adherence to Federal and State regulatory requirements</li>\n</ul>\n",
