It is the MDA&rsquo;s intent to provide the DRFP in phased increments. The purpose of this approach is to share information in stages as it becomes available, thereby providing ample time for feedback and refinement prior to issuance of the final RFP.&nbsp; Once all documents associated with the DRFP have been posted, the solicitation notice will be updated to state as such. <u>The <strong>first</strong> increment includes:</u></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Draft ABS Program IDIQ Performance Work Statement (PWS)</li>\n\t<li>Draft ABS Program Task Order_Mission Planning and Test Execution PWS</li>\n\t<li>Draft ABS Program Task Order_Operation and Sustainment (O&amp;S) PWS</li>\n\t<li>Draft Contract Data Requirements List (CDRLs)</li>\n\t<li>ABS Program Industry Day Registration Form</li>\n\t<li>ABS_Bidders Library Request Form</li>\n\t<li>Draft Bidders Library Attachments: Bidders Library 1_Applicable Documents and Bidders Library 2_PUGS&nbsp;<strong>(Controlled Access_Vendors must submit the ABS Bidders Library Requst Form for access)</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Note: On May 7, 2025 a seperate SAM.gov posting was established for additional Bidders Library documents associated with the ABS Draft Request for Proposal. Navigation to that posting is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Title: AirBorne Sensors Program (ABS) Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) Partial Bidders Library</p>\n\n<p>Notice ID: HQ085525E0001BL</p>\n\n<p>Attachments: Bidders Library 3_NGS and Bidders Library 4_Aircraft</p>\n\n<p>Link:&nbsp;https://sam.gov/opp/0e4172eae7f24042b223578bb1f7c3df/review</p>\n\n<p><u>The <strong>2nd</strong> DRFP increment includes:</u></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Draft ABS4 Section L (Posted 5.29.25)</li>\n\t<li>Draft ABS4 Section M (Posted 5.29.25)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><u>The <strong>3rd</strong> DRFP increment includes an update to the &quot;AirBorne Sensors Program (ABS) Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) Partial Bidders Library&quot; Notice ID: HQ085525E0001BL&nbsp;(https://sam.gov/opp/0e4172eae7f24042b223578bb1f7c3df/review):</u></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Bidders Library 3_NGS and Bidders Library 4_Aircraft (Posted 7.1.25)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><u>The <strong>4th</strong>&nbsp;DRFP increment includes:</u></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>ABS Program Industry Day Q&amp;A&#39;s (Posted 7.25.25)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><u>The <strong>5th</strong>&nbsp;DRFP increment includes:</u></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>ABS Draft RFP Additional Q_A&#39;s (Posted 10.8.25)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The purpose of providing these drafts is to exchange information to improve understanding of the Government&rsquo;s requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government&rsquo;s requirements and enhancing the Government&rsquo;s ability to obtain quality services.
